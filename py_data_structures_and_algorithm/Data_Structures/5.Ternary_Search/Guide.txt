1. Create class Node with an object.
   - The __init__ constructor has leftNode is the Lesser, middleNode = Equals to, and rightNode = Greater 

2. Create class TST with object.
   - Let __init__ constructor be 'self'
   - Create PUT method which takes 'self', 'key', and 'value' pair
   - Define PUT ITEM method which takes self, node, key, value, and index
   - Define the GET method which takes parameter self and key
   - Define the recursevely called getItem method in get()

3. Test with App.py 
   - Import TST class
   - reference the class obj setting it 'tree'
   - tree.put(...) and try to print tree.get(...)
